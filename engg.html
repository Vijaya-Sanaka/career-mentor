<h2 id="adm">B.Tech Admissions</h2>
<p>Engineers are some of the highest-paid professionals across the world, especially in western countries, so it is 
naturally a dream for many in India to make a career in the engineering field. The aspiration to become high-earning 
professional drives many to take admission in engineering courses. In India, becoming an engineer is something most of
 the science students strive for. Therefore, the competition to gain admission into the top engineering institutes of 
India is quite intense.</p>

<p>To ensure that only the best are granted admission, there are various entrance examinations or tests for Bachelor of
 Technology or B.Tech. courses offered in institutes across the country.</p>

<p>Entrance examinations such as JEE Main, JEE Advanced, BITSAT, AP EAMCET help the institutes to screen students according
 to merit. These entrance examinations test the prospective engineering students on the basics of engineering, which is 
in line with their 10+2 syllabus. Based on the performances in the above-mentioned entrance examinations, individuals 
are selected and further screening processes take place, before finally gaining admission to B.Tech. programme.</p>

<h2>List of Top Engineering Courses in India</h2>

<h3>Computer Science Engineering</h3>

<p>     Computer Science and Engineering is all about the development of hardware and software. The sudden boom in the
 industry in the last decade has given a commendable rise to opportunities and pay band as well. Among the bestengineering
 courses, Computer Science and Engineering offers good placement to students in marquee companies. Amazon, LinkedIn, IBM, 
TCS, Adobe, NXP Technologies,Samsung R&D, Kraftly are some of the companies which hire computer science professionals.</p>


<h3>Aeronautical Engineering</h3>

<p>          Aeronautics is the talk of the town for years, and research and development in the area has given a face to the career 
in this branch. Aeronautical engineers are considered to the highest paid engineers in the industry and are experts 
in dealing with the design and development of aircrafts and spacecrafts. They can also take up the job profile of 
mechanical design engineer, aircraft production engineer, aerospace designer checker, consultants, and graduate engineer trainees.</p>


<h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>

<p>             mechanical engineering is among the top of the list of best
 engineering courses. B.Tech Mechatronics and B.Tech Mechanical Engineering have been opted the highest in last
 few years. Mechanical Engineers can find employment in government organizations like Railways, SAIL, Metro Projects,
 BHEl and others, and private organizations like TATA Motors, BAJAJ, Honda, ISRO, COAL INDIA, NAVY, Ford, Design Tech
 System Ltd, and many more.</p>

<h3>Electrical and Electronics Engineering </h3>

<p>              The field equips young students with the acumen to develop, test and repair electrical components.
An electrical & electronics engineer can work with the industries deals in product development, control system, 
system management, product design, sales, consumer’s electronics, transportation, wireless communication, manufacturing,
 chemical, automotive, defense and space research organizations.
 </p>

<h3>Electrical and Communication Engineering</h3>

<p>               The branch of engineering dealing with electronic gadgets and gizmos, circuits, and the various types
 of communication equipment like the IC (integrated circuits), transmitter, receiver, ECE (Electronics and 
Communication Engineering) is one of the most rapidly rising course-fields in India.Opportunities for ECE students are also 
available in several companies (both Governmental and Non-Governmental) in various fields like designing, manufacturing, 
installing, operating and subsequent maintenance of the electronics systems and corresponding equipment. In other words, 
there is a large scope to secure a central government job or a state government job, or a job in either of the public &
 private sectors.</p>

<h3>Civil Engineering</h3>

<p>                Civil engineering is one of the oldest known branches of engineering which basically deals with the planning, designing, 
construction and maintenance of all the infrastructure that we see in today’s world which includes work of roads, buildings, 
canals, bridges, dams, sewers, tunnels etc. It’s traces can be seen since times immemorial. From ancient civilization to today’s 
well planned modern cities, from ancient monuments to today’s jaw-dropping sky touching buildings,
 every single physical concrete structure is a creation of civil engineering.It is the broadest and most versatile branch of 
engineering which we encounter in our daily life.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope of BTech</h2>

<p>Those individuals who have completed their BTech course are called engineers. Depending on the specialisation,
 the prefix will be added to the engineer. For example, if the individual has completed in computer science and engineering,
 then he or she will be called a computer engineer or those who have done in nuclear science will be called a nuclear
 engineer. Those who have done B.Tech course can either start working or go for further studies and do their Masters 
and beyond.</p>
<h4>What to do after B.Tech – Top Career Options After B.Tech</h4>
