<p>Every year millions of students dream of studying medicine. However, only a few manage to secure MBBS admission in India.
 Getting an MBBS seat is a highly competitive affair. More than 18 lakh aspirants compete every year to get a seat in the 
renowned medical college in India. The very first challenge candidates face getting MBBS admission is qualifying for the 
NEET.<p>

<p>The National Testing Agency (NTA) conducts the NEET exam once a year. NEET-UG is the single national level entrance test
 conducted for MBBS admission in India, as recognized by the Supreme Court of India. Admission to 1,899 MBBS seats in AIIMS
 institutions and 249 seats in JIPMER is also granted through the NEET exam. A total of 612 medical colleges, 15 AIIMS, and
 2 JIPMER institutions grant MBBS admission based on NEET results. Comparing the MBBS seats and the number of aspirants who
 appear in the exam, the competition for MBBS admission in India is increasing exponentially.


<p>Many students who qualify NEET exam with low marks struggle to get admission in government medical colleges. Whereas the 
fees of private MBBS colleges are very high. In India because of the high tuition fees many students from the middle-class
 struggle to get MBBS admission. The only hope of these students is to get MBBS admission in India only if they qualify for
 NEET exams with good marks.</p>
